# Hyperconnectome Runtime Model

Status: conceptual / unimplemented

## Runtime representation

Represent an active Hyperconnectome implementation as a temporal attributed multilayer hypergraph:

`H(t) = (V, E_s, E_c(t), H_f(t), X(t), P(t), M(t), Q(t))`

Where:

- `V` = functional subsystem nodes;
- `E_s` = structural reachability fixed by anatomy or hardware;
- `E_c(t)` = configurable routes, subscriptions, permissions, and bindings;
- `H_f(t)` = transient functional hyperedges active at time `t`;
- `X(t)` = local and shared runtime state;
- `P(t)` = plastic parameters governing future state transitions;
- `M(t)` = modulatory and interoceptive state;
- `Q(t)` = resource and quality-of-service state such as energy, heat, bandwidth, latency, damage, and confidence.

The HC is not an indiscriminate all-to-all network. It is a dynamically composed system in which specialized subsystems form transient coalitions when several domains jointly constrain an interpretation, prediction, memory update, or action.

## Subsystem contract

Each top-level HC subsystem should expose an explicit contract:

```text
SUBSYSTEM {
  subsystem_id
  accepted_inputs[]
  emitted_outputs[]
  local_state_schema
  update_rule
  confidence_or_uncertainty_model
  provenance_policy
  resource_budget
  plasticity_permissions
  observability_hooks
  failure_mode
}
```

Repository folders are architectural responsibility boundaries, not claims that each subsystem corresponds to one anatomical lobe, software process, or isolated mini-brain.

## Output contract

A useful minimum output record is:

```text
OUTPUT {
  producer
  payload_type
  payload
  timestamp
  confidence
  provenance
  scope
  expiry_or_persistence_rule
  requested_effect
}
```

`payload` and `requested_effect` remain separate. A subsystem may report, predict, or recommend without automatically controlling downstream action.

## Typed connections

Candidate pairwise relation types include:

- `OBSERVES`
- `QUERIES`
- `ROUTES_TO`
- `MODULATES`
- `EXCITES`
- `INHIBITS`
- `CONSTRAINS`
- `RECALLS_FROM`
- `WRITES_CANDIDATE_TO`
- `CONTEXTUALIZES`
- `PREDICTS_FOR`
- `ERROR_SIGNALS_TO`
- `PROPOSES_ACTION_TO`
- `ARBITRATES_WITH`
- `CONSOLIDATES_INTO`

A typed edge is not evidence of causal truth unless the implementation actually enforces that causal relation.

## Functional hyperedges

Many meaningful HC events involve more than two subsystems simultaneously. A transient coalition such as:

`{deep memory, current memory, pragmatics, affect, self identity} -> interpretation`

is better modeled as a functional hyperedge than as an artificial serial chain with one supposed owner.

Minimal form:

```text
HYPEREDGE {
  hyperedge_id
  participants[]
  trigger
  shared_schema
  arbitration_rule
  start_time
  ttl_or_dissolution_condition
  confidence
  provenance
  resource_budget
  plasticity_effects_allowed[]
  perturbation_handle
}
```

## Shared state

Shared state is not unrestricted global memory. Every shared object needs ownership, versioning, provenance, scope, and stale/contested handling.

Candidate families include perceptual scene state, body state, current context, working bindings, current goals, uncertainty/disagreement, resource state, and action candidates.

A shared-state item may be uncertain, contradicted, stale, or disputed; the runtime must preserve those distinctions.

## Distributed arbitration

The HC requires arbitration without creating a homunculus or master mind.

Different arbitration loops may resolve candidate actions, memory writes, interpretations, resource claims, or output renderings. A resolver mechanism may select which hypothesis is provisionally acted upon or which candidate receives resources, but selection does not make a proposition true.

## Runtime loop

Generic closed-loop operation:

`sense -> update local state -> publish observations with provenance -> form/revise coalitions -> generate competing hypotheses/goals -> arbitrate under body, evidence, capability, and resource constraints -> act/communicate -> observe consequences -> update confidence and eligible plastic state -> consolidate under the appropriate learning rule`

This is descriptive, not a single synchronous clock.

## Time-scale separation

At minimum, distinguish:

- reflex / actuator stabilization;
- fast sensory integration;
- conversational and working-memory cycles;
- deliberate planning and social reasoning;
- interoceptive/endocrine modulation;
- episodic encoding;
- semantic/procedural consolidation;
- long-term topology and policy adaptation.

Transient state must not automatically promote into deep memory, identity, or long-term semantics.

## Failure containment

Relevant failure classes include subsystem silence, stale-state propagation, runaway recurrent coalitions, excessive synchronization, arbitration deadlock, provenance loss, hallucinated shared state, memory-write amplification, plasticity runaway, resource starvation, modulatory saturation, and false certainty.

Each subsystem and functional coalition should expose perturbation and observability handles sufficient for controlled lesioning, isolation, replay, rollback, and degradation testing.
